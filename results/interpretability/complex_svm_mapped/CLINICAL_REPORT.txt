PATHWAY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Known Sepsis-Related Pathways Identified:

• Interferon gamma signaling
  ID: R-HSA-877300
  Relevance: Critical in sepsis immune response. IFN-γ dysregulation is a hallmark of septic shock.
  Clinical Impact: High - Therapeutic target

• Regulation of lipid metabolism by PPARalpha
  ID: R-HSA-400206
  Relevance: Metabolic dysregulation in sepsis. PPARα modulates inflammatory response and energy metabolism.
  Clinical Impact: Medium - Metabolic indicator

• Interferon alpha/beta signaling
  ID: R-HSA-909733
  Relevance: Type I interferons play dual roles in sepsis, contributing to both host defense and immunopathology.
  Clinical Impact: High - Biomarker potential

Novel/Candidate Pathways (28 total):

These pathways may represent:
- Previously unrecognized sepsis mechanisms
- Context-specific regulatory pathways
- Potential new therapeutic targets

Top 10 novel pathways for further investigation:
  - R-HSA-109581
  - R-HSA-1650814
  - R-HSA-1839124
  - R-HSA-216083
  - R-HSA-381119
  - R-HSA-390466
  - R-HSA-450531

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Based on the identified biomarkers and pathways, we recommend:

1. BIOMARKER VALIDATION
   - Conduct targeted proteomics/transcriptomics validation
   - Focus on top 10 protein biomarkers identified
   - Validate in independent cohorts

2. PATHWAY-BASED INVESTIGATION
   - Interferon signaling pathways: High priority for mechanistic studies
   - Metabolic dysregulation (PPARα): Assess as prognostic marker
   - Novel pathways: Functional validation experiments

3. CLINICAL TRANSLATION
   - Consider multi-marker panels combining top proteins
   - Evaluate predictive performance in prospective cohorts
   - Assess potential for early sepsis detection

4. THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS
   - Identified pathways suggest potential drug targets
   - Interferon modulation may offer therapeutic benefit
   - Metabolic interventions warrant investigation

5. FURTHER RESEARCH
   - Investigate novel biomarkers with high scores
   - Study biomarker dynamics across sepsis progression
   - Integrate with clinical variables for improved prediction
